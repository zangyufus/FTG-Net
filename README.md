# NUIST-Facade-Datasets-
This is a building facade point cloud dataset that can be used for the field of point cloud semantic segmentation. The dataset was acquired using MLS (Mobile Laser Scanning) on the campus of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China, and includes data from academic buildings, student dormitories, and blocks.
# Setup
